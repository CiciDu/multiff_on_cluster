# Multifirefly-Project
## Project Description
For this project, we analyze the behavioural data of monkeys playing a virtual-reality game called the multiple-firefly game.

## Packages required to run the code
Since all codes are run in Google colab, all packages that need to be installed are included in the codes in the colab notebooks.

## Data
The monkey data is stored at a confidential location. Please ask the author for data access if needed.

## Description of Directory
Below is a description of each of the files or folders under the root directory.

#### Folders
* agent_data: contains data concerning the RL agents
* monkey_data: a placeholder; to access real data, please contact the author
* RL: directory containing the environment, functions, and stored models for the RL agents
* functions: directory containing the functions that are used for data wrangling, EDA, visualization, modeling, etc

#### Files
* visualization.ipynb: contains code to make visualizations based on the monkeys' or the agents' data
* animation.ipynb: contains code to make animation of the monkeys' or the agents' behaviors in the game
* SB3.ipynb: contains code for the RL agents (using the Stable Baselines3 package)
* LSTM.ipynb: contains code for the RL agents that utilize LSTM networks

## Directions on Acquiring and Running the Code
1. Clone the main repository (https://github.com/CiciDu/Multifirefly-Project.git) to the local server.
2. Ensure that you can open and run Colab Notebooks.
